                New Minecraft Java edition version - 1.17
            </h3>
            <p>
                1.17, the first release of Caves & Cliffs, is a major update to Java Edition announced at Minecraft Live 2020 and released on June 8, 2021. This update adds amethyst geodes along with amethyst blocks and items, copper ore and its derived forms, deepslate and its variants, and the goat, glow squid and axolotl mobs.

                On April 14, 2021, Mojang Studios announced that the update would be split into two updates due to the amount and complexity of content, as well as team health. Multiple features such as revamped mountain and cave generation, the lush caves and dripstone caves biomes, and increased world height were removed on 21w15a, and are set to release for 1.18. A data pack was included in the Minecraft.net article for 21w15a that re-enabled the removed features, and subsequent snapshots updated this data pack. The latest data pack for the full 1.17 release, named the Caves & Cliffs: Part II Preview, can be downloaded here.
